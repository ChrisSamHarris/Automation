# ===== Notes =====
#Average of weather and temp for a 2 day period? 
#Create a list/ Dictionary from the Json file and then iterate the next X days - 2 days if its re. office 
#Shell script to automate the job on a tuesday midday? 
#for loop so if a forecast says rain it highlights "Rain is forecast!" - Advanced - highlight which day and time 



#Future task - Python & CronJob (possibly schedule? ) - Create a Python job that gets the days weather and then create an email to send the weather forecast to my email in the morning
